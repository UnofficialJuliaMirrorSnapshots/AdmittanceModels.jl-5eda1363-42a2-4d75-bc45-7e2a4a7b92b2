AdmittanceModels.jl was developed in 2019 by Michael G. Scheer. The package accompanies the paper by Michael G. Scheer and Maxwell B. Block titled [Computational modeling of decay and hybridization in superconducting circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11510). Michael and Max previously coauthored a Python implementation of the functionality in this package. The Python implementation was used in early drafts of the paper cited above, but the figures in the latest draft of the paper were created with the code in the `paper` folder of this repository. Thanks to Andrew Keller and Alex Mellnik for helpful advice on Julia best practices and to Dan Girshovich for helpful advice on both the Python and Julia implementations.
